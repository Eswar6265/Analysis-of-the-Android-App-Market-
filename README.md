**ðŸ“˜ Project Description**
In this project, I explored over 10,000 Android apps and their associated user reviews to understand factors that drive app popularity and user satisfaction. Using TextBlob, I extracted polarity and subjectivity scores from user reviews. I compared paid vs free apps, ratings, and categories to determine sentiment and retention strategies. The dataset was preprocessed and analyzed with the goal of producing actionable insights.

**Data Files:**

apps.csv: App metadata (category, size, rating, type, price)

user_reviews.csv: Pre-processed user reviews with sentiments

**âœ… Project Tasks**
Load app and review data

Clean missing values and filter invalid entries

Engineer review length, polarity, and subjectivity

Normalize sentiment features

Analyze rating distribution by category and type

Plot review sentiment vs category using box/violin plots

Visualize sentiment with word clouds for positives and negatives

Train SVM model to classify sentiment (tuned via GridSearchCV)

Evaluate sentiment prediction with confusion matrix and reports
